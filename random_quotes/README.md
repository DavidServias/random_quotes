# Using Github!!

I think I might be using Git and Github the way it's supposed to be used now. At first it
seemed a little mysterious. I was just uploadeding files rather than pushing them with Git,
but now I think I git it (rimshot). (I'm sure I'm the first person to think of that joke.)

Do the hashtags do what I think they do? Yes, they do, as long as you put a space between the 
hashtag and the heading.
